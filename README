Sedimentology

  -- a bukkit plugin that simulates erosion and sedimentation.

~~~~

This plugin attempts to create processes that are involved in the
transport and deposition of sediments:

- water picking up material
- transportation down slopes
- weather influence
- material falling down cliffs
- material decaying/degrading into smaller grained materials

The plugin doesn't properly recreate real geologic processes, instead
it mimics the bahavior of erosion and deposition by rolling a dice
for most of the factors involved, and if the roll was succesful,
proceed to the next step.

Material hardness and resistance are taken into account - some
materials are easier displaced than others. Some materials degrade
easier than others. Some materials (sand) have a different angle
of repose.

This plugin isn't meant to enhance game play per se, it will operate
slowly over time and vegetation will prevent most of it's effects
from taking a toll on the landscape in most cases, so it will
take a long time in default settings from actually doing anything
noticeable. Because dirt naturally gets a grass cover in Minecraft
it will be unlikely that this plugin does significant damage to your
world. Of course, planting stuff is still advisable if you want to
reduce the effects of the plugin further.

Commands

  /sed is equivalent to /sedimentology.

  /sedimentology stats

Display statistics from the plugin. The plugin keeps internal counters
for modifications made and attempts, and this command allows you to
display those statistics.

  /sedimentology blocks <integer>

Modify the number of blocks per cycle that the plugin will
attempt to consider for modification. Note that due to the various
factors involved, this number will almost never equal the number of
modifications made per cycle - but increasing it will accelerate the
erosion process.

  /sedimentology protect <boolean>

This option was removed in Sedimentology-6. Instead, the flag can be
specified from the config.yml file instead.

  /sedimentology list

List the worlds that will get the effects of this plugin

  /sedimentology enable <world>
  /sedimentology disable <world>

Enable or disable the effects of this plugin for a particular world.

  /sedimentology help

Displays a help message describing the commands available.

All these plugins require the "sedimentology" permission.

config.yml

Sedimentology uses the standard config.yml method to store
settings. The following fields are known by the plugin, and may be
overwritten if you change settings in the game (default settings
shown here):

blocks: 10
ticks: 1
protect: true
worlds:
- world

- blocks:
    modifies the amount of attempts per world that the plugin
makes each interval to modify the world. The higher the number,
the more blocks will move or decay. If 0, the plugin is effectively
disabled. High numbers can cause lag and a high server load. Numbers
above 500 are not advised for deployment even with high end servers.

- ticks:
    modifies the interval, in minecraft ticks, that the plugin
will run as. There are 20 minecraft ticks in a second. Higher values
mean more time in between plugin doing things.

- protect:
    Enable Factions or Towny protection, if present. If Factions
or Towny are not present, has no effect - disabling all protection.

- worlds:
    A list containing worlds that should be modified by the plugin.
Worlds should be specified with a leading hyphen, one per line. Use
the command if unsure about the format instead.

Factions / Towny

Both Factions and Towny are optional and this plugin will work even if
they are not installed. If they are present however, the plugin will
stop making modifications to claimed blocks. This can be configured
disabled with the /sedimentology protect command.

While I tested Factions support thoroughly, I can't currently test
Towny integration, so feedback appreciated if you can test this for me.
