Sedimentology - a bukkit plugin that simulates erosion and sedimentation.

This plugin attempts to create processes that are involved in the transport
and deposition of sediments:
- water picking up material
- transportation down slopes
- weather influence
- material falling down cliffs
- material decaying/degrading into smaller grained materials

The plugin doesn't properly recreate real geologic processes, instead it
mimics the bahavior of erosion and deposition by rolling a dice for
most of the factors involved, and if the roll was succesful, proceed
to the next step.

Material hardness and resistance are taken into account - some materials
are easier displaced than others. Some materials degrade easier than
others. Some materials (sand) have a different angle of repose.

This plugin isn't meant to enhance game play per se, it will operate slowly
over time and vegetation will prevent most of it's effects from taking
a toll on the landscape in most cases, so it will take a long time in
default settings from actually doing anything noticeable. Because dirt
naturally gets a grass cover in Minecraft it will be unlikely that
this plugin does significant damage to your world. Of course, planting
stuff is still advisable if you want to reduce the effects of the plugin
further.
